This is a simple exercise implementation of Conway's game of life in Ruby. It's pretty
limited right now. The inefficient implementation and limited visualization capacity
make it most suitable for a visual introduction to the basics of the game (for now). It
is also pretty good for manual experimentation with small patterns.
In the future I hope to expand its capability (see TODO).

To try it out, make sure that you have execute permission on mainscript.rb. Running 
./mainscript.rb will give you a blurb on usage. Or you can try this example if you just
want to see what happens:

  $ ./mainscript.rb -i cels/koksgalaxy.cel -g 8

This example shows a period 8 oscillator. After 8 generations, the original is reproduced.

Some patterns produce demonstrably infinite population growth. Try:

  $ ./mainscript.rb -i cels/gosperglidergun.cel -g 90 -d 0.1

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life for a description of Conway's
rules, history, etc.

Another good resource is http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/. The Life Wiki contains a vast
catalogue of patterns to try as well as explanation.

Implementation notes:

My implementation considers anything outside the edges of the .cel file to be dead cells.
Because of this, patterns do not behave well if they run into the edges.

Right now I determine simulation dimensions from the length of the first line and the 
number of lines in the file. I also expect the file to be fully filled in, i.e. there 
should be no lines with a different number of characters than the first line. .cel files 
that don't follow these guidelines will behave strangely!

I have just started development on this project. I would like to fix these shortcomings 
in the future. See the TODO file for things I'd like to change/add/etc.
