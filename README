This is a simple exercise implementation of Conway's game of life in Ruby. It's pretty
limited right now.

To try it out, make sure that you have execute permission on mainscript.rb. Running 
./mainscript.rb will give you a blurb on usage. Or you can try this example if you just
want to see what happens:

$ ./mainscript.rb cels/koksgalaxy.cel 8

This example shows a period 8 oscillator. After 8 generations, the original is reproduced.

Some patterns are demonstrably infinite. Try:

$ ./mainscript.rb cels/gosperglidergun.cel 30

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life for a description of Conway's
rules, history, etc.

Another good resource is http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/. The Life Wiki contains a vast
catalogue of patterns to try as well as explanation.
